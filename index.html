<div class="projects" id="about">
<p class="about">I choose the subject Creative Computing because I find coding really fun and what will become an important life skill in a devoloping world and work force. 
It is incredibly interesting to me to find out how the world around us works, not just the science and social sciences, but now also the way computers and tecnologies comunicate and intergrate into our lives. 
I don't have a lot of experience, but I am willing to work hard to catch up to my classmates. 
I enjoy a challenge and logical thinking and problem solving. 
My favourite part of Digital Tecnology last year was learning coding; both HTML and CSS and Python. 
This year I looking forward to practising and building on these skills from last year.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Project 1- HTML and CSS</button>
<div class="content">
 <p> Our first project of the year was HTML and CSS and Networks. 
 We spent the first lesson learning Binary and Hexadecimal then we learnt about how computers and networks use Binary to comunicate and send messages. 
 I found this really interesting beacuse it was all things I never knew existed and happened all around me everyday. 
 We quickly moved on to create our own website, without much guidence using our knowlage from years prior. 
 Our task was to create a Portfolio Website to store our work throughout the year. 
 We first looked at a website we liked for ideas to make our own website the best it could be. 
 I looked at the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.au/#gs.ys2UjLcS">World Wildlife Fund</a> website and my main two takeaways were, try and keep the color sceme simple and not make it too busy and that it was interesting to be able to browse and scroll down through the website. 
 I started pretty simple, make a title, header and div's. 
 I secoundly moved on to create a navigation bar, like on the WWF website, to find your way easily to the different projects. 
 After fixing up the asthetics I still had a few more lessons. 
 I decided to try and make collapsable buttons to store my projects. 
 I asked Mr Morffew and with his help found a page on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_collapsible">W3Schools</a> explaining how to do this. 
 After implimenting this I re-fixed the asthetics to incorperate this element. 
 I enjoyed this task, I love coding and a website is a very practical application as well as fun and creative.

<button class="collapsible">Project 2- Virtual Reality</button>
<div class="content">
 <p>In this unit we were allowed to choose an area that interested us. 
 I have always been fasinated by Virtual Reality and it is a bit different than my usual preferance of coding.
We first completed a research task, in which I learnt alot about what Virtual Reality is and it's postives and negitives.
Then we submitted a project plan.
I started my unit simple; 3D pictures.
I learnt to use the schools GoPro Fusion 360 which allowed me to take pictures around the school.
Then you had to blend the pictures, to make a 360 veiw and I uploaded them to a site called Google Tours.
Google Tours allows you to get these images from google maps or upload your own. 
Putting the images together I could create a virtual tour of the school.
Once I had finished this we still had 2 weeks left, so I got to move on and explore other elements of Virtual Reality.
In my opinion this was the fun bit!
I used the schools headset with a feature called Google Blocks.
This allows you to build scenes and objects in 3D while on the headset.
The tecnology is amazing. 
I spent a lesson watching youtube videos to learn the very basics and then had a go.
I (admitiedly) spent a good 5 minutes building 'brick towers' like a 2 year old being absolutely fasinated and getting the hang of it.
Then I tried other features like customising the size, shape and colour of the objects.
I, then, decided to try and make something more complex- a human. 
I have to admit, I am not the most artistic person and I was still getting the hang of it, so it didn't look very good.
Moving on I tried to make a simple block like horse; which despite not being scientifically acurate or proportionate, looked ok.
I found this unit alot of fun and learnt a whole new side to art/ games/ worlds and digital technology I was oblivious to.
I faced small issues with downloading or learning to use the camera, but nothing dramatic- just what you would expect when you have no idea how to do something.
I think I worked well and I could improve next time mainly with my increased knowlage, meaning I could move on to more complex things.
Looking back on this unit the only thing I would have done differently would be to spend more time useing GoogleBlocks because that was really fun.</p>
